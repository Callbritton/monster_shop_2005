As a Merchant

When I visit my dashboard (/merchant/dashboard), I see a link to apply discounts

As a Default User

After my discounts are set, I see the discount terms on the (/merchant/:id/items)

When a user adds enough value or quantity of a single item to their cart, the bulk discount will automatically show up on the cart page.

When there is a conflict between two discounts, the greater of the two will be applied.

Final discounted prices should appear on the orders show page.
